        <p>Spaetzle is a type of soft egg dumpling that is a traditional dish in southern Germany. It is made from a simple batter of flour, salt and eggs, which is then pushed off a wooden board with a metal card or a knife into boiling water to cook. The resulting dumplings (never call it noodle) are typically served as a side dish with meat and gravy, or topped with cheese and fried onions for a popular variation known as Kaesespaetzle.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients per person</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>50g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>Butter (optional)</li>
            <li>Grated cheese and browned onions (never fried) for topping (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the eggs.</li>
            <li>Beat the mixture until a thick batter forms and big bubbles appear. The batter should be slightly sticky but still flowing slowly. If it's too thick, add an egg and so much flour, that the consistency gets right.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of well salted water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Scrape small amounts of batter off the board forming long, sometimes a little thicker spaetzle.</li>
            <li>Cook the spaetzle for 2-3 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the water and transfer them to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Between the several cooking rounds, put some butter on the warm spaetzle.</li>
            <li>If desired, you can fry the cooked spaetzle in butter until they are golden brown for added flavor and texture.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, topped with grated cheese and browned onions if desired.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your homemade Spaetzle!</p>
