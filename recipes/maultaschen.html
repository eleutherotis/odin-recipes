        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Maultaschen are a traditional German dish, particularly popular in the Swabian region. They are large, filled pasta pockets that resemble ravioli or dumplings. The filling typically consists of a mixture of minced meat (usually pork or beef), spinach, onions, breadcrumbs, and various herbs and spices. The dough is made from flour, eggs, and water, rolled out thinly, and then filled with the meat mixture before being sealed and cooked.</p>

            <li>Add the simmered ingredients and stir until it is evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Roll out the pasta dough on a floured surface to about 1-2mm thickness. Cut the dough into rectangles of approximately 10cm x 20cm.</li>
            <li>Spoon a generous amount of the filling onto one third of each pasta rectangle. Fold the third over the remaining dough two times to create a sealed pocket. Press the edges firmly to ensure they are well sealed.</li>
